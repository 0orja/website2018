            <p>
              The School of Biology of the Faculty of Biology and Medicine at the University of Lausanne (UNIL) proposes the Summer Undergraduate Research (SUR) Programme for the uninitiated to obtain that first experience. During 8 weeks in July and August, the SUR Programme hosts about 20 Bachelor (first university degree) students with both biological and medical studies background from around the world (including 1-2 from Lausanne). Each participant will perform an individual research project in a different laboratory of the Faculty of Biology and Medicine. This programme aims to attract outstanding motivated students from near and far for a research experience that will remain with them for their lifetimes. While most of the time is spent in the host lab, each week the students come together for shared academic activities, often with participants of the sister programme at the EPFL. These activities include introductory student research presentations, lectures from faculty members on research topics and their career paths, and career guidance workshops in academia and beyond. At the end of the summer, students present the results of their research on a poster during a joint UNIL/EPFL Symposium and write a final report. Students also enjoy many social activities, including a hike in the Alps, barbecues, swimming in Lac Léman, and visits to other cities in Switzerland!  (https://www.unil.ch/eb-sur/en/home/menuinst/introduction.html)

              <br>Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship Program Rockefeller University
            </h2>
            <p>
              The Rockefeller University Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program provides a unique opportunity for undergraduates to conduct laboratory research. SURF students work with leading scientists in a broad range of areas including biochemistry; structural biology and chemistry; molecular, cell and developmental biology; immunology; virology and microbiology; neuroscience; physics; and mathematical biology. College sophomores and juniors are eligible to spend 10 weeks during the summer in a Rockefeller University laboratory. The program begins in early June and ends in mid-August. Placement in laboratories is centralized through the Dean’s Office. Students are matched with laboratories according to their stated research interests, and work on projects under the direct supervision of faculty, postdoctoral fellows and/or senior graduate students. Each year, students are chosen from a wide variety of applicants with diverse scientific backgrounds and training. Annually, more than 700 students apply for admission into the SURF Program and approximately 20 are accepted. International students are eligible to apply. In order to fully experience the world of scientific research, SURF students are required to present and discuss scientific publications at weekly Journal Club meetings. This exposure allows participants to familiarize themselves with speaking to a scientific audience. SURF students also attend a special lecture series where Rockefeller faculty discuss their research and the evolution of their scientific interests. At the end of the program, SURF students will present their research results to fellow students and mentors at a poster session. SURF students receive a stipend of $5,000.00. Free housing will be provided for students who cannot commute. Campus facilities include a tennis court, a recently renovated gym and adjacent east west esplanade for jogging, running, walking, or roller blading. SURF students are encouraged to attend social and cultural events occurring both on and off campus. Organized outings for SURF students have included trips to see a Broadway show and professional baseball game. The Rockefeller University’s campus, located on New York City’s Upper East Side, is set among beautifully kept gardens and trees on a 15-acre campus overlooking the East River. A diversity of restaurants, shops and entertainment adds to this culturally enriched area of Manhattan. The rest of New York City is conveniently accessible by train, bus or taxicab.  (https://www.rockefeller.edu/education-and-training/surf/)

              <br>NYU Tandon Undergraduate Summer Research Program
            </h2>
            <p>
              Each summer, members of the School of Engineering faculty open up their labs to allow NYU Tandon, NYU CAS/Tandon 3+2, and NYU Abu Dhabi rising sophomore, junior, and senior undergraduate students to complete 10 weeks of hands-on research. Students work full time in the labs with their faculty mentors and other mentors on various research topics while also participating in seminars presented by distinguished administrative and academic personnel. In addition, research presentations and poster sessions are held in which students have the opportunity to present their research to peoples of all disciplines and backgrounds. At the end of the program, abstracts of the research are published and presented to incoming students during Undergraduate Orientation. The Undergraduate Summer Research program is open to all NYU Tandon, NYU Abu Dhabi, NYU Shanghai, and NYU CAS/SOE 3+2 rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors who have a GPA of 3.0 or above. At the beginning of the spring semester, the Office of Academic Affairs emails the faculty research projects and any special requirements student researchers must have (i.e. lab experience, specific completed coursework, minimum GPA) to all Tandon students. NYU AD, NYU Shanghai, and NYU 3+2 students receive this information from their program coordinators. Students then fill out the application, including a short statement of intent, a resume, and an unofficial transcript in which they may apply for up to three different projects if they so choose. The faculty then review applications and select the student researcher that best fits their researching needs. Selected students will work full-time (35 hours per week) on a paid basis on one project. Please note that students are not allowed to take courses or hold another job that will interfere with this full-time commitment.  (http://engineering.nyu.edu/research/undergraduate)
